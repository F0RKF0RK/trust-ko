THIS FILE HAS ABOUT 3,300 WORDS TO TRANSLATE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

When translating this thing, only edit the stuff that's BETWEEN the <tags>, like so:

    <p id="still_english">hello</p>
    =>
    <p id="still_english">bonjour</p>

Also, DON'T change anything between the [square brackets], like so:

    Number #[N]
    =>
    Numero #[N]

Exception to the "don't change tags" rule:
Feel free to move around the italics & bold tags, so that the emphasis
on the right phrases/words still makes sense!

    <i>italics</i>
    <b>bold</b>

Also, some HTML weirdness you might want to know:

    &amp; is an ampersand "&" sign
    &#8226; is a dot
    &rarr; is a rightward-facing arrow
    &lt; is a "<" sign

ALSO! I'd love for you to credit yourself as a translator!

<p id="intro">
제1차 세계 대전 도중, 갑작스러운 휴전이 있었습니다.
<br><br>

때는 1914년 크리스마스, 서부 전선.<br>
적에 대한 긴장을 <i>풀지 말라</i>는 엄격한 명령에도 불구하고, <br>
영국과 독일의 군인들은 참호 밖으로 나와 무인 지대를 가로질렀습니다. <br>
그렇게 한데 모인 양군은 동료의 시신들을 묻어주고 선물을 주고 받으며 게임도 했답니다. <br>

<br><br>

그 사이, 2017년이 되었네요. 서방 세계는 수십 년 동안 평화를 유지해왔습니다.<br>
우리는요? 우리의 서로에 대한 믿음은 <i>엉망입니다</i>. 지난 40년간의 설문에 의하면, <br>
서로를 신뢰한다는 사람들이 점점 줄어들고 있다고 합니다. 여기 우리의 퍼즐이 있습니다.
<br><br>

<b>왜 평화로운 세상에서도 친구가 적이 되는가?<br>
그리고 왜 전쟁통에서는 적도 친구가 되는가?</b>
<br><br>

<b>게임 이론</b>이 우리에 유행하는 불신 바이러스를 설명할 수 있을 것 같습니다.<br>
또 어떻게 바로잡을 수 있는지도요! 그래서, 이 모든 것을 이해하기 위해...

<b>신뢰 게임</b>
<br>
당신은 하나만 선택할 수 있습니다.

앞에 보이는 것은 기계입니다. 이 기계에 동전을 넣으면 <i>상대</i>는 동전 3개를 얻습니다.
마찬가지로 상대가 동전을 넣으면 당신이 동전 3개를 얻습니다.

두 사람은 각자 <b>협력</b>(동전을 넣음) 을 선택하거나 <b>사기</b>(동전을 넣지 않음) 를 선택할 수 있습니다.

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
만약에 당신은 협력, 상대는 사기를 선택했다면 당신은 동전 1개를 잃고 상대는 3개를 얻습니다. (점수: -1 : +3)
하지만 만약 둘다 사기를 선택했다면 아무도 동전을 얻거나 잃지 않습니다. (점수: 0 : 0)

<b>결국 당신은 '사기'를 쳐야합니다.</b>

<b>그런데 이제는 상대가 협력한다고 합니다.</b><br>
당신은 어떻게 하시겠습니까?

</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
왜냐면, 만약 둘다 협력했다면 둘다 동전 하나를 포기하고 세 개를 얻는거죠. (점수: +2 대 +2)
하지만 만약 당신이 사기를 치고 상대는 협력을 했다면 당신은 동전 세 개를 얻고 상대는 하나를 잃습니다. (점수: +3 대 -1)
<b>결국! 어쨌든 우리는 사기를 쳐야합니다.</b>

그리고 <i>이게</i> 우리의 딜레마입니다.
신뢰는 좋지만 다른 사람이 당신을 이용하게 될 수도 있습니다. 혹은 참호에서 비무장상태로 나오자마자 총을 맞게될 수도 있지요.

Oh, by the way...
</p>
<p id="tournament_2">
...You may be skeptical about that Christmas Truce story about the World War I trenches.
Surely that was just a fluke?
</p>
<p id="tournament_3">
Yes, the truce was dramatic, but it was <i>neither unique, nor unusual</i>.
</p>
<p id="tournament_4">
Not <i>every</i> trench joined in the peace, but it was pretty widespread.
Many front-lines came up with the idea independently, and again: <i>despite</i> specific, strict orders not to.
</p>
<p id="tournament_5">
And in fact, even <i>before</i> Christmas, several front-lines already <i>had</i>
established an unofficial, secret peace.
</p>
<p id="tournament_6">
They called it: <b>the "live and let live" system.</b>
Basically, you don't shoot me, I don't shoot you. And this worked, in a lot of places!
</p>
<p id="tournament_7">
You may still be skeptical. Most soldiers don't spontaneously form peace with the enemy.
What's so special about <i>trench</i> warfare? 
</p>
<p id="tournament_8">
Well, here's what's unique about the trenches:
unlike almost every other form of war,
you have to face the same <i>specific soldiers</i> every day.
</p>
<p id="tournament_9">
<b>It's a repeated game.</b> And that makes <i>all</i> the difference.

<!-- - - - - EVOLUTION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="evolution_intro">
Now, let's let our population of players <i>evolve over time</i>. It's a 3-step dance:
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_1">
<b>1. PLAY A TOURNAMENT</b><br>
Let them all play against each other, and tally up their scores.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_2">
<b>2. ELIMINATE LOSERS</b><br>
Get rid of the 5 worst players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_3">
<b>3. REPRODUCE WINNERS</b><br>
Clone the 5 best players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_footer">
...and REPEAT, for as long as you'd like.
Note: you don't have to wait for people to literally die &amp; reproduce for culture to evolve --
all that's needed is that "unsuccessful" behaviors go away, and "successful" behaviors are imitated.
So now...
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_button">
...let's see this in action. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_1">
Say we start with the following population of players:
<span class="all_c">15 Always Cooperates</span>,
<span class="all_d">5 Always Cheats</span>, and
<span class="tft">5 Copycats</span>.
(We'll ignore <span class="grudge">Grudger</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Detective</span> for now)
<br><br>
We're going to do the tournament-eliminate-reproduce dance a dozen times or so.
Let's make another bet! Who do you think will win the <i>first</i> tournament?
<b>PLACE YOUR BETS, AGAIN:</b>
</p>

<p id="evo_2_all_c">
Makes sense, <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span> outnumbers everyone else right now...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_all_d">
Makes sense, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> has a lot of <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span> to exploit...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_tft">
Makes sense, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> won the tournament last time, why not again?...
</p>
<p id="evo_2">
Let's see if you're correct:
</p>

<p id="label_play_tournament">
1) play tournament
</p>
<p id="label_eliminate_bottom_5">
2) eliminate bottom 5
</p>
<p id="label_reproduce_top_5">
3) reproduce top 5
</p>

<p id="evo_3_all_c">
Alas, <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span> got eaten up by
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>, whose numbers have now increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_all_d">
Sadly, you were correct! The <span class="all_d">Always Cheaters</span> won this time, 
and their numbers increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_tft">
Alas, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> did not win – but at least they didn't do as bad
as <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>. They got eaten up by <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>,
whose numbers have now increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3">
But let's try a few more rounds of this...
</p>

<p id="evo_4">
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> is still growing,
at the expense of <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>...
</p>

<p id="evo_5">
And now, all the <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span> are dead.
But, wait...
</p>

<p id="evo_6">
That's right: the <span class="all_d">Always Cheats</span> became a victim of their own success!
They exploited the naive <span class="all_c">Always Cooperators</span>,
but once they ran out of them, they had to face the <span class="tft">Copycats</span>:
who <i>are</i> nice, but not naive.
</p>

<p id="evo_7">
By simply copying the other player's moves,
<span class="tft">Copycats</span> can play nice with each other,
while <span class="all_d">Always Cheats</span> just cheat themselves!
Not only that, but it also means <span class="tft">Copycat</span>
can give <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>
a taste of their own medicine.
</p>

<p id="evo_8">
And so, as a result...
</p>

<p id="evo_9">
...<span class="tft">Copycat</span> inherits the earth.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_c">
So, although your bet was off -- the nice-but-naive <span class="all_c">Always Cooperators</span>
were doomed from the start -- in the end, a <i>smart</i> form of niceness prevailed,
and the <span class="all_d">Always Cheaters</span> were squashed.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_d">
So, in the short run you were right - <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> won the first few rounds,
but in the end, its exploitativeness was its downfall.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_tft">
So, in the long run, you were right - <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins!
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> may have won in the short run,
but its exploitativeness was its downfall.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_end">
This reminds me of a quote:
<br><br>
<i>"We are punished by our sins, not for them."</i><br>
~ Elbert Hubbard
</p>
<p id="evo_9_btn">
(oh, and by the way...)
</p>

<p id="evo_10">
(...this result is similar even if we put
<span class="grudge">Grudger</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Detective</span> back in:)
</p>

<p id="evo_autoplay">
start the evolution process!
</p>
<p id="evo_autoplay_stop">
stop the evolution process
</p>

<p id="evo_10_followup">
(Note: sometimes, a few <span class="grudge">Grudgers</span> may stick around,
because when all players except <span class="grudge">Grudger</span> &amp; <span class="tft">Copycat</span> 
are eliminated, the two tie.)
<br><br>
So, it seems the math of game theory is telling us something:
that <span class="tft">Copycat's</span> philosophy,
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", may be not just a 
<i>moral</i> truth, but also a <i>mathematical</i> truth.
However...
</p>
<p id="evo_10_btn">
...there's a problem: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_11">
Look around. The world's full of total jerkwads.
<br><br>
If <span class="tft">Copycat</span> is the strategy in this repeated game of trust that's so powerful --
that even soldiers in World War I trenches independently "evolved" a similar strategy, called "live and let live" -- 
why, then, are there so many un-trusting, un-trustworthy people?
What's causing our epidemic of un-trust?
<br><br>
A clue's in that sentence itself. "In <i>this</i> repeated game of trust."
So far we've only talked about change in the players:
what about <i>a change in the game?</i>
What could lead to...
</p>
<p id="evo_11_btn">
...the evolution of <i>distrust?</i>
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - DISTRUST - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="distrust_1">
Before everything goes to heck, let's start with something nice!
Here's a world filled entirely with <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span>,
except for one <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> and one <span class="tft">Copycat</span>.
<br><br>
Use the buttons on the right to <b>START</b> the sim,
go through it <b>step-by-step</b>, or <b>reset</b> it. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_2">
As you already know, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins handily in the long run,
under our current rules!
<br><br>
But that's under our <i>current</i> rules, which say that
players play against each other for <i>10</i> rounds per match.
Does <span class="tft">Copycat</span> still win at 7 rounds? 5 rounds? 3? 2? 1?
<br><br>
<b>Change the number of rounds</b> with the slider below,
then <b>START</b> the sim, and see what happens.
Feel free to experiment!
</p>

<p id="distrust_2_end">
once you're done playing around, click:
</p>

<p id="distrust_3">
As you saw, if you don't play enough rounds, (here: 5 or less)
<span class="all_d">ALWAYS CHEAT</span> dominates.
<br><br>
In 1985, when Americans were asked how many close friends they had,
the most common answer was "three". In 2004, the most common answer was <i>"zero"</i>.
We now have fewer friends across class, racial, economic, and political lines,
because we have fewer friends -- <i>period.</i>
And as you just discovered for yourself,
<b>the fewer "repeat interactions" there are, the more distrust will spread.</b>
<br><br>
(no, mass media doesn't count:
it must be <i>two-way</i> interactions between <i>specific individuals</i>.)
</p>
<p id="distrust_3_btn">
and oh, it gets worse... &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_4">
There's <i>another</i> way to breed distrust.
Here are the "payoffs" for the trust game:
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_2">
With the normal payoffs, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins.
But now, <b>change the "both cooperate" reward from +2 to +1</b>,
then click <b>START</b>.
Even though +1 is still <i>more</i> than the punishment for both cheating (0)...
what happens?
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_note">
feel free to play around with different payoffs!
once you're done, click:
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_note_2">
(simulating: 10 rounds per match)
</p>

<p id="distrust_5">
The same thing happens:
with a lower "win-win" reward, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> takes over.
Game theory has two powerful ideas about this:
<br><br>
<b>"Zero-sum game".</b> This is the sadly common belief that a gain for "us"
<i>must</i> come at a loss to "them", and vice versa.
<br><br>
<b>"Non-zero-sum game".</b> This is when people make the hard effort
to create a win-win solution! (or at least, avoid a lose-lose)
Without the non-zero-sum game, <i>trust cannot evolve.</i>
<br><br>
Speaking of which,
let's now look at our third &amp; final barrier to the evolution of trust...

<p id="noise_1">
As cool as <span class="tft">Copycat</span> is, it has a huge, fatal weakness I haven't mentioned yet.
To understand the problem, let's say two <span class="tft">Copycats</span> are playing against each other:

<p id="noise_1_end">
Being "nice" players, both their first moves will be:

these two <span class="tft">Copycats</span> will spiral into an endless cycle of vengeance...
that started over a single mistake, long ago.
</p>
<p id="noise_5_end">
Tragic. But now, are there <i>other</i> types of players who can...
</p>
<p id="noise_5_btn">
...deal with mistakes? &rarr;
</p>

<p id="noise_characters">
Let's meet some new faces! (or, new hats, anyway)
</p>

<p id="character_tf2t">
<b>COPYKITTEN:</b><br>
Hello! I'm like <span class="tft">Copycat</span>,
except I Cheat back only after you Cheat me twice in a row.
After all, the first one could be a mistake! Purrrrr
</p>

<p id="character_pavlov">
<b>SIMPLETON:</b><br>
hi i try start cooperate.
if you cooperate back, i do <i>same thing</i> as last move, even if it mistake.
if you cheat back, i do <i>opposite thing</i> as last move, even if it mistake.
</p>

<p id="character_random">
<b>RANDOM:</b><br>
<i>Monkey robot! Ninja pizza tacos! lol i'm so random</i><br>
(Just plays Cheat or Cooperate randomly with a 50/50 chance)
</p>

<p id="noise_characters_end">
Alright, let's see how well these peeps do when they...
</p>
<p id="noise_characters_btn">
...play in a tournament &rarr;
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_1">
Let's start with a dozen
<span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span>,
versus our old winner, the fair <span class="tft">Copycat</span>,
and our three new characters:
the forgiving <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span>,
the dull <span class="pavlov">Simpleton</span>, and
the silly <span class="random">Random</span>.
<br><br>
In each round of a match, players have a small chance of making a mistake. (let's say, 5%)
Who do you think will come out on top?
<b>Think carefully, then PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_2">
Alright, you bet [CHAR] wins. Let's find out!
Use the controls to your left to <b>START</b> the sim in quick mode,
or go through it <b>step-by-step</b>.
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_2_2_correct">
You were correct -- 
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_2_2_incorrect">
Your bet was close, but no cigar -- 
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_2_2">
<span class="pavlov">Simpleton</span> wins!
This is because <span class="pavlov">Simpleton</span> is actually capable of
exploiting <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>. They both start cooperating,
but if <span class="pavlov">Simpleton</span> makes a mistake and cheats,
since <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span> never retaliates,
<i>it'll keep cheating them</i>.
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_2_2_btn">
Now let's try...
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_3">
...the same thing as before, except instead of half-<span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>,
it's half-<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>. It's a much <i>less</i> forgiving,
<i>more</i> hostile environment.
<br><br>
Who do you think will win now? <b>Think, then PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_4">
You bet on [CHAR]. Again, go through the simulation...
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2_correct">
You were right on the money -- 
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2_incorrect">
Good guess, but someone else took the prize -- 
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2">
<span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins this time!
That's surprising that with an even <i>meaner</i> starting population,
<span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span>,
a <i>more forgiving</i> version of <span class="tft">Copycat</span>,
was the most successful! (note: <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> is so forgiving
it doesn't even <i>entirely</i> wipe out <span class="tft">Copycat</span>. it shares room)
<br><br>
In this case, a bit of "miscommunication" (5% chance of mistake each round) could lead
to more <i>forgiveness</i>. But is this true for <i>all</i> levels...
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2_btn">
...of miscommunication?
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_5">
<b>Use the slider below to change the amount of "miscommunication", then hit START.</b>
At 5%, <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins.
What happens at 0%? Or 20%? Or 50%? (it only goes up to 50%,
because at that point, <i>every</i> move is a coin flip) 
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_5_continue">
When you're done playing around, click:
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_6">
The results turn out something like this:<br>
<b>At 0%,</b> the fair <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins!
<b>At 1% to 9%,</b> the forgiving <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins!
<b>At 10% to 49%:</b> the unfair, unforgiving <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> wins.
<b>At 50%,</b> <i>nobody wins ever.</i>
<br><br>
This is why "miscommunication" is such an interesting barrier to trust:
a <i>little</i> bit of it leads to forgiveness,
but <i>too much</i> and it leads to widespread distrust!
I think our modern media technology,
as much as it's helped us increase communication...
has increased our <i>miscommunication</i> much more.
<br><br>
At last, let's experiment with <i>all</i> the numbers, the knobs and sliders.
Let's play...

<!-- - - - - CONCLUSION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="conclusion_0">
Game theory has shown us the three things we need for the evolution of trust:
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a">
1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a2">
Trust keeps a relationship going,
but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions <i>before</i> trust can evolve.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a">
2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a2">
You must be playing a non-zero-sum game,
a game where it's at least possible that <i>both</i> players can be better off -- a win-win.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a">
3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a2">
If the level of miscommunication is <i>too</i> high, trust breaks down.
But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be <i>more</i> forgiving.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_4">
Of course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this.
There's reputation, shared values, contracts, cultural markers, blah blah blah.
And let's not forget...
</p>
<p id="conclusion_btn">
...the <i>biggest</i> lesson. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="outro_1">
If there's one big takeaway<br>
from <i>all</i> of game theory, it's this:
<br><br>
<b>What the game is, defines what the players do.</b><br>
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,<br>
it's that our <i>environment</i> acts against the evolution of trust.
<br><br>
That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment --
but as game theory reminds us, we <i>are</i> each others' environment.
<b>In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run,
it's us players who define the game.</b>
<br><br>
So, do what <i>you</i> can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.
Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly.
Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches,
cross No Man's Land to come together...
